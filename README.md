## Description

This is a simple demonstration site with minimal styling, showcasing an understanding of Event Handling in JavaScript.

The user is presented with multiple forms to fill out, Madlib style, at which point the user can click a Submit button. Once clicked, text will appear in the lower body of the page, presenting the user with a story using words and phrases previously entered in the aforementioned forms. 

When the Submit button is clicked and the story is presented, a Reset button is then presented to the user. If clicked, the story will disappear and the previous input values for each form will be reset to a null state. 

The user can then repeat the process.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the current repository to working directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

* User can input anything into form boxes and the page will print the respective input, without checking if the input is valid.
